I will generate a **README.md** file based on the contents of your **LR_TidyModels.Rmd** file. First, I'll extract the key information from the file and then format it into a **README.md**. Let me process it now.

Based on the contents of **LR_TidyModels.Rmd**, I will generate a **README.md** file summarizing the project, its purpose, methodology, and usage.

# Supervised Learning with Gene Expression Data

## **Project Overview**
This repository contains an implementation of **Logistic Regression using the TidyModels framework** to predict inflammation status in **Ulcerative Colitis (UC)** based on **gene expression data**.

## **Dataset**
The gene expression dataset is sourced from the **GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)** database, specifically from the study:

**"Regional variation in gene expression in the healthy colon is dysregulated in ulcerative colitis"**

- **GSE Dataset ID:** *[Insert GSE ID here]*
- **Number of Patients:**  
  - 67 patients with **ulcerative colitis**  
  - 31 **control** subjects (23 healthy + 8 with inflamed non-IBD biopsies)
  
The study investigates gene expression variations in **different regions of the colon** and how they become dysregulated in UC.

## **Objective**
The goal of this project is to:
1. **Identify the most differentially expressed gene** in ulcerative colitis using **differential gene expression analysis**.
2. **Use that gene as a predictive marker** for classifying inflammation status.
3. **Implement a Logistic Regression model** using **TidyModels** to assess predictive performance.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Retrieve gene expression data from **GEO**.
   - Filter dataset to retain only **gene names** for analysis.

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Perform **Differential Expression Analysis**.
   - Select **DUOX2** as the most significantly expressed gene (used as predictor).

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Implement **Logistic Regression** using **TidyModels**.
   - Evaluate performance using **ROC curves, AUC, accuracy, and other metrics**.

## **Results**
- **Logistic Regression achieved an AUC of 0.849**, indicating **strong predictive performance**.
- DUOX2 expression was found to be **highly associated with inflammation in UC**.

## **Usage**
### **Running the Analysis**
To reproduce this analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arjunsinhharer-bioinformatics/Supervised_Learning_W_GeneExpression.git
   cd Supervised_Learning_W_GeneExpression
   ```

2. **Install required R packages**:
   Open R and run:
   ```r
   install.packages("tidymodels")
   install.packages("BiocManager")
   BiocManager::install("GEOquery")
   BiocManager::install("limma")
   ```

3. **Run the R Markdown script**:
   ```r
   rmarkdown::render("LR_TidyModels.Rmd")
   ```

## **Dependencies**
- R version 4.1+
- TidyModels (`tidymodels`)
- GEOquery (`Bioconductor package`)
