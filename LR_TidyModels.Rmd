# TidyModels Logistic Regression Implementation

Tidymodels is a collection of R packages designed for modeling and machine learning using a tidyverse-friendly approach. It provides a consistent and user-friendly interface for building, training, evaluating, and tuning models. The framework is designed to integrate well with tidyverse principles, making it particularly synergistic with packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr.

For this TidyModels implementation I will take gene expression data from GEO and use differential gene expression analysis to find the most expressed gene. I will use that gene as a basis for predicting inflammation status in Ulcerative Colitis. 

This GSE-ID corresponds to the study named "Regional variation in gene expression in the healthy colon is dysregulated in ulcerative colitis". 

This study contains 67 patients with ulcerative colitis and 31 control subjects. (23 normal patients and 8 patients with inflamed non-inflammatory bowel disease biopsies)

I begin with loading all the necessary pacakges that I think I'll need. I also trim the expression data such that I'm only looking at Gene Names. 

## 1.) DOWNLOAD DATA & PACKAGES


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(GEOquery)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidymodels)

# Load the GEO dataset
gset <- getGEO("GSE11223", GSEMatrix = TRUE, AnnotGPL = TRUE)[[1]]

# Extract expression data
ex <- exprs(gset)

# Extract sample metadata
meta <- pData(gset)

# Extract platform annotation
platform <- annotation(gset); gpl <- getGEO(platform); platform_data <- Table(gpl)

#USE THE PLATFORM DATA TO ADD GENE_SYMBOLS AS ROW NAMES TO EXPRESSION DATA
# Convert 'ex' to a data frame and add row names as a column
ex_df <- ex %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "ID")  # Keep row names as 'ProbeID'

# Ensure both ID columns are character
ex_df <- ex_df %>%
  mutate(ID = as.character(ID))

platform_subset <- platform_data %>%
  dplyr::select(`ID`, `GENE_NAME`) %>%
  mutate(`ID` = as.character(`ID`))  # Convert ID to character


# Now perform the left join
annotated_ex <- ex_df %>%
  left_join(platform_subset, by = "ID")

annotated_ex <- annotated_ex %>%
  dplyr::select(GENE_NAME, everything())  # Move GENE_NAME to first position

annotated_ex <- annotated_ex %>% filter(!is.na(GENE_NAME))

annotated_ex <- annotated_ex %>%
  mutate(GENE_NAME = trimws(GENE_NAME)) %>%  # Remove extra spaces
  filter(GENE_NAME != "")  # Remove empty values

annotated_ex <- annotated_ex %>% drop_na()


annotated_ex_trim <- annotated_ex %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(ID, GENE_NAME))  # Removes ID and GENE_NAME, keeping only expression data


# Ensure that annotated_ex_trim and annotated_ex have matching rows
annotated_ex_trim <- annotated_ex_trim %>%
  mutate(GENE_NAME = annotated_ex$GENE_NAME[match(rownames(annotated_ex_trim), rownames(annotated_ex))])

# Remove any rows where GENE_NAME is missing
annotated_ex_trim <- annotated_ex_trim %>%
  filter(!is.na(GENE_NAME))

# Aggregate duplicate gene names by averaging their expression values
annotated_ex_trim <- annotated_ex_trim %>%
  group_by(GENE_NAME) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Convert to a standard dataframe (not a tibble)
annotated_ex_trim <- as.data.frame(annotated_ex_trim)

# Assign GENE_NAME as row names
rownames(annotated_ex_trim) <- annotated_ex_trim$GENE_NAME

# Remove the GENE_NAME column as it's now the row names
annotated_ex_trim <- annotated_ex_trim[, !colnames(annotated_ex_trim) %in% "GENE_NAME"]


```
I find the highly correlated genes here. I do this using a variance based metric to find the highest correlation between gene pairs. I then trim duplicate gene pairs to only keep a unique pair of highly correlated genes. The reason I do this earlier is because I want all the important variables defined and clear before I begin the tidymodels logistic regression implementation. 

## 2.) FIND HIGHLY CORRELATED GENES (HCGs)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Compute variance for each gene
gene_variances <- apply(annotated_ex_trim, 1, var, na.rm = TRUE)  # Variance per gene

# Select the top 1000 most variable genes
top_1000_genes <- names(sort(gene_variances, decreasing = TRUE)[1:1000])

# Filter the expression matrix to include only these genes
annotated_ex_trim_top1000 <- annotated_ex_trim[top_1000_genes, ]

# Transpose the matrix (samples as rows, genes as columns)
annotated_ex_trim_top1000_t <- t(annotated_ex_trim_top1000)

# Compute Spearman correlation
cor_matrix <- cor(annotated_ex_trim_top1000_t, method = "spearman", use = "pairwise.complete.obs")


# Convert the correlation matrix to a long format for easy filtering
cor_long <- as.data.frame(as.table(cor_matrix))

# Rename columns
colnames(cor_long) <- c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Correlation")

# Remove self-correlations (where Gene1 == Gene2)
cor_long <- cor_long %>%
  filter(Gene1 != Gene2)

# Find the most highly correlated genes (abs correlation >= 0.7)
highly_correlated_genes <- cor_long %>%
  filter(abs(Correlation) >= 0.7) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(Correlation)))


```


To check if the annotated expression data is normalized I do 2 checks. First I make boxplots as I've done in previous assignments. The relative horizontal linearity amongst these boxplots is indicative that the data is normalized. Aditionally the distribution of the expression data follows the shape of a gaussian normal distribution, also indicative of normalization. 

## 3.) NORMALIZATION CHECK

```{r}

#Check for log transformation
hist(as.numeric(unlist(annotated_ex_trim)), breaks = 50, main = "Distribution of Data", col = "blue")
all(annotated_ex_trim > 0, na.rm = TRUE)  # Log-transformed data should have only positive values

boxplot(annotated_ex_trim, main = "Boxplot of Samples", col = "lightblue")

```
In this part of the script, I just get all the necessary variables needed for the 7 different implementations that will be required for the assignment. The outcome data I'm looking at are which patients have inflammation versus those who do not have inflammation.

## 4.) PREPARE OUTCOME DATA FOR TIDYMODELS

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
outcome <- meta %>%
  dplyr::select(`inflammation_status:ch1`) %>%
  dplyr::rename(Status = `inflammation_status:ch1`) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Binary = ifelse(Status == "Inflamed", 1, 0))



```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Remove duplicate correlation values
highly_correlated_genes_trimmed <- highly_correlated_genes %>%
  distinct(Correlation, .keep_all = TRUE)

```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Convert rownames to a column and select only Sample_ID and Binary
outcome_fixed <- outcome %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Sample_ID") %>%  # Convert rownames to a new column
  select(Sample_ID, Binary)  # Keep only relevant columns

```



## 5.) Find the Top Differentially Expressed Gene

When I use `limma` to find the top differentially expressed gene, I start by creating a model matrix with `model.matrix(~ Binary, data = outcome_fixed)`, which tells `limma` how to separate **Inflamed (1)** and **Uninflamed (0)** samples. Then, I fit a linear model to each gene using `lmFit(annotated_ex_trim, design)`, which models gene expression as a function of the **Inflamed vs. Uninflamed** condition. Next, I apply empirical Bayes moderation with `eBayes(fit)`, which stabilizes variance estimates and improves statistical power. Finally, I extract the top differentially expressed gene using `topTable(fit, coef = 2, number = 1, sort.by = "p")`, selecting the gene with the smallest adjusted p-value. `limma` needs `outcome_fixed` because differential expression analysis requires known group labels—without them, `limma` wouldn’t know which samples to compare. By incorporating these steps, I effectively identify the most significantly differentially expressed gene between conditions.

```{r}
library(limma)

# Create model matrix for the binary condition
design <- model.matrix(~ Binary, data = outcome_fixed)

# Run limma analysis
fit <- lmFit(annotated_ex_trim, design)
fit <- eBayes(fit)

# Get top differentially expressed gene
top_de_gene <- rownames(topTable(fit, coef = 2, number = 1, sort.by = "p"))

cat("Most differentially expressed gene:", top_de_gene, "\n")

```

We can now see that the most differentially expressed gene is dual oxidase 2. With this in mind we will use this gene as the basis of the logistic regression.

After looking into it more DUOX2 plays a critical role in **mucosal immunity and oxidative stress** within the gut. Research has shown that **increased DUOX2 expression is associated with intestinal inflammation**, particularly in diseases like ulcerative colitis (UC). My model further supports this connection, demonstrating that **DUOX2 expression levels effectively distinguish between inflamed and non-inflamed UC states**. This finding highlights DUOX2 as a potential molecular marker for **inflammation severity in UC**.

Clinically, these results suggest that **DUOX2 expression could serve as a biomarker for disease activity in UC**. If validated in larger studies, this marker could assist in **early diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment monitoring**. By tracking DUOX2 levels, clinicians might be able to **predict disease progression and assess therapeutic response**, ultimately improving patient management. Moving forward, I plan to validate this model in independent cohorts and explore its potential for integration into **clinical decision-making frameworks**.

After running all of this code the workplace will inevitably be filled with lot's of data and variables. This code helps me focus and keep what's important. We have the expression data we trimmed up. We have a list of highly correlated genes that is trimmed up. We have the outcome data for the tidymodels implementation and the top differentially expressed gene. 

## 6.) WORKSPACE ORGANIZATION

```{r}
#CODE TO DE-CLUTTER THE WORKSPACE
# List all objects in the environment
all_objects <- ls()

# Specify the datasets to keep
datasets_to_keep <- c("highly_correlated_genes_trimmed", "annotated_ex_trim", "outcome_fixed", "top_de_gene")

# Remove all objects except for those specified in datasets_to_keep
rm(list = all_objects[!all_objects %in% datasets_to_keep])
```

## 7.) LOGISTIC REGRESSION CLASSIFCATION

### Get all the data together

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


# Extract expression values for "dual oxidase 2"
top_gene_expression <- annotated_ex_trim %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Gene") %>%
  filter(Gene == "dual oxidase 2") %>%
  column_to_rownames(var = "Gene") %>%
  t() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Sample_ID") %>%
  rename(DUOX2_Expression = "dual oxidase 2")  # Rename for clarity

# Merge with outcome data
logistic_data <- outcome_fixed %>%
  inner_join(top_gene_expression, by = "Sample_ID")

# Convert to tibble for tidymodels
logistic_data <- as_tibble(logistic_data)

# Print structure to confirm
print(logistic_data)

```

### Split the Data

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
data_split <- initial_split(logistic_data, prop = 0.8, strata = Binary)
train_data <- training(data_split)
test_data <- testing(data_split)

train_data <- train_data %>%
  mutate(Binary = as.factor(Binary))

test_data <- test_data %>%
  mutate(Binary = as.factor(Binary))


# Verify structure before proceeding
print(colnames(train_data))

logistic_recipe <- recipe(Binary ~ DUOX2_Expression, data = train_data) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())  # Normalize DUOX2 expression



```

### Define and Train the Model

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
logistic_model <- logistic_reg(mode = "classification") %>%
  set_engine("glm")

logistic_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(logistic_model) %>%
  add_recipe(logistic_recipe)

# Train the model
logistic_fit <- logistic_workflow %>%
  fit(data = train_data)

```

### Make predictions on the test set

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
predictions <- logistic_fit %>%
  predict(new_data = test_data) %>%
  bind_cols(test_data)

# Print some predictions
print(head(predictions))

```

### Evaluate Model Performance

```{r}
# Get predicted probabilities instead of just class
predictions <- logistic_fit %>% 
  predict(new_data = test_data, type = "prob") %>% 
  bind_cols(test_data)  # Merge with test data to retain Binary column

# Verify column names
colnames(predictions)

# Ensure Binary is a factor
predictions <- predictions %>%
  mutate(Binary = as.factor(Binary))

# Compute AUC
auc <- roc_auc(predictions,
               truth = Binary, 
               .pred_0,  # Make sure this column exists, change if needed
               event_level = "first")$.estimate

# Print AUC
print(auc)



```

### Confusion Matrix

```{r}
predictions <- predictions %>%
  mutate(.pred_class = ifelse(.pred_1 > 0.5, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(.pred_class = as.factor(.pred_class)) # Ensure it's a factor for classification

conf_mat(predictions, truth = Binary, estimate = .pred_class)



```
The confusion matrix provides a breakdown of classification performance:

True Negatives (TN): 25 (correctly predicted no inflammation)
True Positives (TP): 7 (correctly predicted inflammation)
False Negatives (FN): 7 (failed to detect inflammation when present)
False Positives (FP): 2 (incorrectly predicted inflammation)


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Convert Binary to factor for classification
predictions <- predictions %>%
  mutate(Binary = as.factor(Binary))

# Define a set of classification metrics
classification_metrics <- metric_set(accuracy, f_meas, spec, sens, npv, ppv)

# Apply the metrics
classification_metrics(predictions, truth = Binary, estimate = .pred_class)

```

### Compute AUC and Generate ROC
```{r}
# Compute the AUC (Area Under the Curve)
auc <- roc_auc(predictions, truth = Binary, .pred_0, event_level = "first")$.estimate

# Generate ROC Curve
g_roc <- predictions %>%
  roc_curve(truth = Binary, .pred_0, event_level = "first") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1 - specificity, y = sensitivity)) +
  geom_path(color = "red") +
  geom_abline(lty = 3) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_bw() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 0.75, y = 0.1, label = paste0("AUC: ", round(auc, 3)), color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Logistic Regression ROC Curve")

# Print ROC plot
print(g_roc)

```

My analysis of the ROC curve indicates that DUOX2 expression is a strong predictor of inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC). The model achieved an **AUC of 0.849**, suggesting **high discriminatory power** between inflamed and non-inflamed states. Since an AUC of **0.8 to 0.9** represents **very good model performance**, this result demonstrates that DUOX2 expression effectively differentiates between inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions in UC.

The shape of the ROC curve further supports this conclusion, as it rises steeply toward the top left, indicating **high sensitivity and specificity**. The model performs significantly better than random classification (AUC = 0.5), reinforcing the biological relevance of DUOX2 in UC-related inflammation. Given DUOX2’s established role in **mucosal immunity and oxidative stress**, my findings align with existing research suggesting its involvement in **intestinal inflammation**.

This model could have **clinical implications**, potentially serving as a **biomarker** for predicting disease activity in UC. If validated in larger, independent cohorts, DUOX2 expression could aid in **early diagnosis** or **monitoring treatment response**. To further improve the model, I could explore **hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and alternative classification methods** such as Random Forest or XGBoost. Additionally, cross-validation would help ensure robustness and generalizability.

These results highlight the potential of DUOX2 as a **reliable molecular marker** for UC inflammation. Moving forward, I plan to refine the model and validate its performance in larger datasets to strengthen its translational value.
